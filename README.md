DowntimePro is a documentation aid during electronic health record (EHR) downtimes! 

**NEED:**
During such downtimes (which occur at least monthly for a few hours for maintenance), physicians are unable to access patient records or make new records of their own to keep track of patients' treatments. 

**SOLUTION:**
DowntimePro provides a convenient location for physicians to store patient notes during EHR downtimes. Through Microsoft Excel integration, physicians can also download a copy of their notes for ease of transfer to the patient's EHR once the downtime is over.
